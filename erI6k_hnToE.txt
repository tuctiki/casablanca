Have it our way from the old birds in
Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai.
You're watching The China Show.
I'm Yvonne Man with David Ingles.
Good morning.
Let's get to your top stories today.
Stocks across the Asia-Pacific in the
green up for a sixth straight session
here.
That's as U.S.
and European Union gear a trade deal
that could actually set tariff rates at
15%.
Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping
set to host EU officials led by Ursula
von der Leyen amid lingering
disagreements over export controls and
China's ties with Russia.
And we're looking at shares of Tesla in
the after hours session, down and down
quite a bit.
In fact, here sales slump.
You have Elon Musk warning of a few
rough quarters ahead.
Right.
Welcome to the show.
A quick glance at market action.
And as we were just pointing out a few
seconds ago, a sixth straight day of
gains, we're now at the highest level in
about four years in the MSCI benchmark
here for the Asia Pacific.
Longest streak of gains going back to
the very start of the year.
Nikkei, 2 to 5, as you can see on your
screen just now within and the topics
index is already there now within about
1% of hitting a fresh record.
As far as that's concerned, trade back
in focus.
You have, of course sky high next within
that story in fact flipped a page please
and have a look at how we're doing those
specific stocks.
Given the earnings beat 68%, I believe
record profit, air spending 3% on the
high index and SK Hynix, TSMC is coming
on line and some of the other iterations
of the trade in the Asia Pacific, with
the exception of Tesco, as you can see,
which is like dancing slightly lower,
most are actually on the up cost Me
index up a further 1%, one of the best
performing markets globally even more so
today.
Currency markets.
We have an ECB decision don't forget
later on today.
More on that in a moment.
A weak dollar story roughly as far as
some of the other Asian affects is
concerned, 146 now or closer to 146 on
the yen.
We haven't had a 714 handle for the
Chinese currency in a while.
In fact, that's now at about an eight
month high.
As far as the Chinese currency, seven
month high.
Thank you so much.
Is concerned very quickly going into the
open today and for once we are looking
at a sideways open and just really
coming off what's been a manic last few
days for Chinese equity markets, four
year highs.
More on that in a moment.
Turn over 1.8 trillion for a second
straight session.
The animal spirits are back, not just in
China.
As you take a look at the milestones, as
you mentioned, but four year highs for
all these gauges in Hong Kong, a CSI 300
as well, eight month highs as well.
And even seeing Chinese long bond sell
off and really joining the sort of rout
in spillover bonds as well.
So certainly, you know, is this sort of
the way to go, given that we're getting
more and more of these trade deals,
there's more optimism around that?
Or are we still complacent about the
fact that a lot of these effective
tariff rates are actually higher than
10%, which was what the best case
scenario used to be?
So is that all going to start to bite at
the end of the road?
Yeah, I guess it depends on the
comparison relative.
It's certainly higher.
The 10% markets seem to be moving along
the narratives that at least we're not
getting the worst case scenario of
another back and forth on on on
retaliatory tariffs from both sides.
All of that being said, we'll see what
happens between the US and the EU,
between EU and China.
Of course, one of the big things that of
course today and of course coming up
here and shows a lot of guests coming
through to talk us through this, this
magic rally we're seeing in equity
markets here in Greater China, number
one.
Number two is, of course, the earnings
that have come through.
There's Tesla.
There's been Alphabet, of course, to
talk us through in various at 174
trillion.
Beth Kendig joins us to talk about that
ETFs greater Chinese markets Chinese
index has done well and of course E
funds has released a new product this
week.
More on that in a moment and of course
more as well on these conversations.
President Xi Jinping, of course, is set
to meet EU officials not in Europe there
in Beijing.
More on that in a moment.
Right.
On the recent trade deals we've seen
this week, you had the Philippines, of
course, did strike a trade deal with the
United States agreeing to a 19% tariff
rate on its exports to the US.
Now, that announcement came as President
Marcos visited the White House for more
on the deal and its impact.
Let's head over to Washington now and in
fact, bring in the Philippine ambassador
to the United States or Save Manuel from
Wild is joining us right now.
Ambassador, good morning from the Asia
Pacific.
Thank you so much for staying up and
joining us today.
Lots to talk about.
Just your initial what do you think the
key takeaways are from this trip, apart
from obviously what's been taking place
along the trade lines?
Well, and good morning to you with David
and Yvonne.
Yes, I just.
Well, essentially, I think on overall,
we found the meeting with between
President Trump and President Marc Rich
to be
sort of like a good a meeting.
And not only that, I think there's
there's a connection there, which is
very important.
I think we all know with President
Trump, he always believes in the a
personal relationship with any with any
leader of any nation.
And I think that President Marcos and
President Trump kind of hit it off very
well.
So having said that, there are many
aspects of our relationship.
It's not only economic, obviously, these
are our a very important defense
alliance with the United States, which
is obviously a key factor in our
relationship right now.
And also, of course, the people to
people ties that we have.
We have 4.3 million Filipino Americans
living in the United States.
And I think we have about 700,000
Americans living in the Philippines.
So with.
I think overall, as I said, it was a
very good,
I would say, an excellent opportunity
for the two leaders to be able to get to
know each other well.
They have known each other even before
President Trump became president, but
this time as both leaders of their
countries.
I think it's it's it's a good start.
Yeah.
Ambassador, the you know, a lot of
attention and understandably so has been
put on, you know, one percentage point
dropped from 20 to 19%.
And some of the critics I'd like to hear
your thoughts on it
have said that President Bongbong didn't
really achieve very much as far as
bringing down that specific tariff.
What is that?
What's the response from the government?
Well, I think that it is that is I would
say that that is the start.
There's still time for us to be able to
get some more details on how we can
manage to bring it, perhaps a little,
much, much lower than that.
We're still looking at the possibility,
but also the details on the on the no
tariffs for any imports coming to the
Philippines.
We're still looking at the there are so
many details that that were not
discussed.
So the discussion with with President
Trump and President Marcos is mostly on
the overall picture of our on the
tariff.
But nothing
came on the details and that that will
have to be discussed by our our
negotiators.
So so 19% may not be final.
Ambassador, I was wondering how what's
the ideal situation?
How low do you think Philippines can go
or is at least aiming for in order to
stay competitive with other Asian
nations?
There was a there was an announcement
that came out of the White House today.
I think that they I think President
Trump said that the lowest he will go is
50%.
So obviously, all countries are going to
try to get to that point.
They 50% tariffs.
So obviously, we would like to see that
happen to our our relations, our trade
agreement with the United States.
Japan, I think, got the 50%
tariff rate, and that's because they
have a $600 billion commitment to invest
in the United States.
We don't have anything like that.
But but just nonetheless, we're still
looking at the possibility of bringing
that lower since you still have time to
negotiate this.
Ambassador, one of the other key
components of the relationship which
you've highlighted, we heard it from
President Trump as well.
The Philippines is a key military
partner.
To that extent, could you maybe shed
some light and more color on what was
announced?
Were there any new security guarantees
or support that the US extended has
extended to the Philippines?
Well, I think what was discussed openly
at the Oval Office was the fact the US
Congress had approved a from their NDAA,
the National Defense
Act, that they will be setting up an
industrial base up of the manufacture of
ammunition and then in the Philippines.
And that is a sort of like a joint
venture.
That is a very good,
what do you call this a template that we
would like to see where we can have the
manufacture of defense
material and it'll create jobs obviously
in the Philippines.
And then that's one way that's an
investment coming into the country.
That's one particular
area where I think there was we had some
discussions on that one, and I think
that both President Marcus and President
Trump see that as an opportunity once
again to strengthen not only our defence
relationship but also our economic
relationship.
Yeah, I believe that.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
I believe that that project is is being
eyed in Subic.
Of course, back, back, back, back in the
Philippines.
I'm wondering, do you have any more
details on that that you could share any
timelines that were talked about as far
as that specific sort of exercise is
concerned?
I think that we we have some companies
in the Philippines that already are in
that business.
And so they're they're actually
in discussion with some of the companies
here in the United States that are also
in that kind of business also, so that
we're looking at the potential joint
ventures or possibly an investment
coming directly from the United States
government.
We'll see what happens.
It's still too early to be able to tell
you any any more than what we already
know, which is basically that there is
an intention to set it up around the
Subic area.
Understood.
And maybe just one last or maybe on
defense here and maybe just to put to
bed as well.
Speculation was there or is there any
material conversation around returning
officially returning military bases to
the issue of US military bases to the
Philippines?
No, there was not.
Mainly because it is clear and we've
made it clear to our friends here in the
United States that
we it's not in our Constitution that we
would not allow bases, foreign bases to
be established in the Philippines.
It is not in the in the constitution of
the Philippines.
Ambassador, I want to get back to sort
of some of the details of this trade
agreement where Marcos did mention that
zero tariffs on U.S.
exports to the Philippines will apply
only to certain products like
automobiles.
Can you can you give us a bit more?
Are there other sort of products or
items that you look at besides
automobiles now?
Well, I think there are quite a number
of
things that are being manufactured in
the United States that we do not have in
Philippines.
I can't specify anymore that, of course,
auto automobiles and auto parts.
And I think
there are other manufacturing
of what you call the machinery that we
could probably import.
We need to we need to start looking into
modernizing some of our manufacturing
plants.
And there are many items.
There's a long list of items that I
think that that could really bump up our
trade between the Philippines and the
United States.
So
we'll see what happens.
As I said, it's still being worked out.
The details are still being
worked out by our trade negotiators.
Was there ever a discussion about rules
of origin or transshipment concerns,
Ambassador?
Because there has been some concerns
that, you know, there could be some
goods that are coming from China, for
example, through Southeast Asian
nations, which we have seen in that
Vietnam deal with the U.S.
as well.
I'm just wondering, were those
discussions ever made?
Well, we are short where we don't have
any of that, but there's no
transshipment coming in to the
Philippines.
And that's the reason why our trade is
is is somewhere between 4.8 to 5
billion.
So there is no there's absolutely no
transshipment that's being done in the
Philippines right now.
Ambassador, final question be.
Did we miss out on anything?
What else do you think is pertinent that
we need to know?
Well, I think what's important, again,
like I said, is that as far as the trade
deal is concerned, we all know that
there's always room for negotiation,
like what happened with Japan and what's
probably happening to the other ASEAN
countries.
And the reason why we came down to the
90% is because that's only what, as
President Trump pointed out, that that
is the base for the Asian countries
right now.
That is the lowest.
But there is room for more
more improvement on the tariff.
As he announced earlier today, that the
lowest goal is 15%.
And so we're all hoping that we'll be
able to bring it down to that level.
What a new normal, isn't it?
Ambassador, thank you so much for your
time and staying up, of course.
And we know it's been an extremely busy
few days for you and your team.
Ambassador Jose Manuel Wilde is there,
the Philippine ambassador to the United
States joining us there out of out of
Washington.
Right.
Going into the open today, just over 15
minutes away.
16 give or take.
It's you know what, ten out of ten,
that's the morning so far you're seeing
here in Hong Kong.
Fantastic weather.
The sun is out.
Finally, just our flat.
Anyway, you can have everything, right?
This is the China show.
All right.
Your agenda here today, of course, at
China EU summit is certainly one thing.
High level talks between Xi and Ursula
von der Leyen.
Certainly that coincides with the EU and
US trade talks that are also undergoing
as well.
How does that factor into what's going
to be happening in this summit this time
around?
That stock's rally, which we talked
about here as well, Certainly one to
watch is the sector.
There's been elderly stocks as well.
We've been focusing on that.
And now there's some data coming through
here, whether it's Macao, visitor
arrivals, there's a CGP sale.
Interesting enough at a time when we
actually are seeing a bit of a bond sell
off in the long end.
And yeah, we also have that July
economic survey too that's coming out
later on today.
Yeah, at some point this morning.
Right now though, that's something
that's coming up is the fix of today.
And we haven't had a 713 handle on this
in a while.
In fact, the strongest fixing since
November of last year, seven 1385.
To be more.
To be more specific, that really goes
into maybe this rally that's taking
place.
Yvonne and I I've talked about this turn
over seven day 1.8 trillion on shore
effectively where we are.
So if you ask us, okay, where exactly is
this rally that's coming up on your
screens very shortly.
Four high highs, not this the other
graphic, please, if we can.
Four year highs on that.
Thank you so much.
Hang Seng Hang Seng, China, Shanghai
2021, I believe 2022 highs and CSI 300
back to about eight month highs.
Just a gauge of momentum on the right
side of your screen.
Yeah.
So things are looking a bit maybe
overheated.
Right.
If you talk about how these are as are
concerns right now.
Let's bring Whitney.
We were talking equity strategies of
BBVA Securities.
You've been just coming back from this
whole financial tour.
A lot of is is is the amount of
southbound flows are like how far do you
think this sort of flow buying can go?
Yeah, I mean, I think the flow buying
can go as long as one is the overall
rate and bank of the environment remains
low.
So whether it's insurers, asset
managers, pensions or even retail
depositors, they are seeking for you for
yield for return and high dividend
yield.
So so you buying looks like a good
alternative you know for them is almost
a sovereign credit and banks have
relatively stable dividend yield right
and to I think you know the chase for
yield might continue as long as people
have low expectations on growth or
better seems.
All right.
So, you know, if people have more higher
conviction on stimulus and growth, they
will be chasing this growth here.
Stocks.
In the past few days, we saw the growth
that the people chasing like commodities
two weeks ago property.
Yeah, but if those themes comes and go
rather than sustaining then money go
back to the defensive to the know the
stocks.
And I think generally people now have
relatively low expectation on policy
stimulus have low conviction on the
growth names.
Right so so these defensive yield names
remain popular.
And also what we observed is for some
financial institutions, they buying
these banks, for example, in gaining a
board seat so that they can do equity
accounting.
So when they look at 0.5 times be
getting the board to see the equity
accounting, they can say, oh, I'm
carrying it at one time book.
So suddenly there is that massive
accounting going which a number of
institutions already booked in the past.
So that's an additional layer of
motivation incentive.
We see distressed asset managers, some
insurers and going forward or
potentially some corporate want to play
this game.
So what's the end game ultimately,
Right?
Not that I'm supportive of this thesis,
but the end game here.
Could it be let's trade the banks all
the way up to one time book, okay.
So that this equity accounting game no
longer makes sense so that the yield go
down to like two point less than 2.5%,
close enough to the government to bond
yield that maybe that's the end game.
But as of now I think, you know, the
pain trade continues and, you know, the
fact that the financials generated the
strong, absolute return to previous
years, banks outperformed both relative
to China market.
This year the China financials actually
is absolute outperform even in the
emerging market or the global context.
Then it actually also attract the more
investors who previously or historically
end their weighted is China.
Banks now need to take another look and
reexamine and to some extent participate
in the pain trade.
What's ironic about this, the more
people that chase this trade and the
better it gets, the lower the yield
eventually.
Yeah, that's right.
Are we at that inflection point?
Are we close to that inflection point?
So interestingly, on this tour, when our
investor met with the insurers, like one
third or even half of the question on
the insurers were about their investment
strategy is like not the business
strategy.
No, not the premium growth.
Not the first, not the V and B marginal.
But it's like, are you buying more
banks?
Are you buying smaller banks other than
the banks?
Are you seeking to get the board to see
what's the lowest acceptable yield you
can you get you can take rate.
So that is actually a key question
because for the eight share banks on
average, for example, in September last
year, the average yield was 68%.
Now it's down to 5%.
And for some Asia banks, the yield is
like have a three handle is 3.1%.
The bar has to keep moving lower.
That's why a lot of investors are asking
how far this can go.
And that's why I say the end game is one
time key.
B you that goes to like 2.1%.
Yeah.
I mean ten year yields at half of 1%,
right?
So there we go.
We'll have more from Wendy Wu in a
moment.
China equity strategist at B of
Securities.
We're talking anti involution.
Full report out plus other themes across
these markets going into the open today.
Time is it's under 7 minutes away flat
open.
This is Bloomberg.
Right.
Welcome back to shows pre markets
looking like this so finally some
consolidation after really what's been a
decent run recently Hang Seng tech is
just within a couple of couple of
percentage points from that high we hit
very recently we have topped those highs
on the Hang Seng China and Hang Seng
index.
As you can see we've haven't been to 25
five actor in a while and some strength
coming through in the Chinese currency
following the strongest effects.
Going back to November of last year.
The exchange rate itself is at about
those levels as well in terms of stocks
to watch or watching the Chinese EV
sector here.
This is on the back of what we heard
from regulators issuing some sort of
ethical guidelines for automated driving
tech.
So this is on the back of what we've
heard from this fatal accident involving
an autonomous Xiaomi vehicle recently.
So certainly that we are seeing some of
these stocks lower this morning, NIO
down some 2% and Tesla.
Right.
So what we heard from Elon Musk saying
that there's going to be some rough
quarters ahead.
We talk about what we've been talking
about.
Is this a is this an automaker?
Is this an AI and robotic sort of
company?
Now, really depends on how you view this
stock, but you're seeing some of the
suppliers actually rally.
Seattle shares are up some 1%.
The open is next.
This is Bloomberg.
Good morning.
Welcome back to shows E!
Yeah, we made it.
We made it through hump day.
It's a day away from the weekend.
It's quite across these markets.
We're still watching out for a lot of
things on the Chinese front,
most of which, of course, will be the
summit taking place today at China's
capital.
We understand, of course, President Xi
Jinping is set to meet
top EU officials and let's see what they
are able to come up with as far as
that's concerned.
In fact, later on in the show, we'll
talk more about this with some guests
coming here as well.
But apart from that, it's quieter than
it is.
But it certainly gives us time to look
at some of the big themes out there.
And, you know, we're hearing from
President Trump about this sort of, I
guess, framework of what these tariffs
are going to look like.
Right.
Looks like it's 15% to 50% is what these
countries might get, whether it's from
these trade talks or in the form of a
letter.
But 15% seems to be the new 10% that we
have to deal with.
And this new tool that well, the new
zero.
So certainly that is the new thing to
watch out for here in the coming days
and months as we get closer to this
August 1st deadline, August 12th, for
China.
As you say, it's quiet, quiet, but
certainly we've hit some pretty key
milestones when it comes to these
Chinese equity markets, whether it's
onshore or offshore.
Right.
You take a look at how CSI 300, we talk
about eight month highs.
I Shanghai Composite, we're at three
year highs right now.
And ever getting close to that 3600
level for Shanghai.
So certainly that's one to watch.
And we're watching, of course, was
happening even in the bond space in
China, which we talked about, you know,
low rates for some time.
But now we're starting to see the sell
off, particularly the long end pick up.
In fact, we're seeing maybe a six day or
seven day now where that 30 year yield
is going to be slightly higher.
So maybe we're finally joining the sort
of rout that we're seeing in the long
ride side of things in China as well.
Why?
Well, you talk about animal spirits come
back on the equity market, this whole
kind of anti-evolution theme.
Maybe this means the economy can escape
deflation.
That certainly is what markets are
starting to reprice here right now.
Right.
Whether that is going to be a you know,
a multi month, multi year story.
We're going to talk to Wendy Wu from B
of A on that as well.
But you talk about how commodities are
doing.
We're actually on offer on some things
like copper, steel and iron ore after
what we've seen is a quite a tremendous
rally of some of these commodities of
late here.
Shanghai crude is slightly higher.
We talk about Tesla.
Not sure if that's really what's driving
some of these Tesla suppliers like
Seattle here today.
The tech space has been on fire here
really in what's led to this rally as
well.
Some of the boards will see what Hong
Kong is doing here.
We talk about the fix as well.
That was quite a strong fix on the PBOC
here.
Once again, Hong Kong is doing this, so
we're much a little bit better.
There you go.
We're upside about a fifth of 1%.
But what we saw yesterday was the eight
share gauge that we're watching very
closely, right at 9250 and change.
Now, that brings us back to the highest
levels we've seen since October of 2021.
So you've got the IPO pipeline that's
been very strong.
Tech certainly is what's been driving a
lot of that as well.
In terms of Hong Kong dollars, still a
little bit on the weaker side, seven
8497 here, but tech seems to be doing
okay.
Okay, right.
Tencent, Alibaba slightly up.
Baidu, though, that's the one that's
actually heading lower.
We're down about two and a half percent
or more here this morning.
So certainly one to watch here is the EV
space.
And we talked about some of these
ethical guidelines that been set here.
So we're seeing a mixed picture across
some of the space here this morning.
And Tesla suppliers we mentioned about
Seattle to see how the shares are doing
here this morning.
But yeah, you know, what we heard from
Elon Musk was a couple of rough patches
ahead.
If you take a look at how shipments and
deliveries are, look looking like here
right now, Seattle shares are slightly
down about 7/10 of 1%.
Dave Yeah, he sees well, a couple of
quarters ahead.
Beth Kendig, in fact, will be joining us
later on the show to talk us through, of
course, the tech side of this
conversation.
Is it a vision problem or is it an
execution problem?
As far as Tesla go, Shares are obviously
off lows of that we saw back in April,
but we're still down about 18% now.
The other conversation we'd want to talk
about, too, as Yvonne was just alluding
to there.
Right.
So it's actually been I just had a look
it's actually been ten years since the
last major initiative on supply side
reform.
Right.
Top panel is industrial profits.
Bottom panel is PI, you know, 2012 to
2015, wholesale price deflation, you had
supply side reforms, which to some
extent of course worked back then.
The world was also a very different
place.
And then as we get into this, the newest
iteration of supply side reform anti
involution, the question is will it work
this time?
And in which sectors should we expect it
to work this time when you would joins
us still an equity strategist at B of
securities.
Why don't we start with with that
question You guys had a full report in
that.
Thank you.
Yeah.
We just published or joined the report
this morning.
I think, you know, a lot of people
compare to the kind of anti-evolution to
the supply side of reform.
Ten years ago, ten years ago, it was
very successful and there was pretty
quick reaction from, you know, to the
turnaround from five years of deflation
to pretty positive territory in two
that.
17.
Economy turned around, The corporate
profit turnaround and stock prices in
the coal and material sector basically
more than doubled in the two year
horizon.
So many ways to look at the playbook and
say, okay, let's buy this.
The stocks we see recently share prices
up like 30, 50% in a month or so in some
of these sectors.
However, we want to highlight at this
time has a few quite important
differences compared to ten years ago.
The first thing is the sector focus is
different, right?
So ten years ago it was mainly old
economy, so you dominated all the
capacity which has been loss making for
some of them being loss making for
years.
Right.
We talk about old economy, metal and
mining, cement, the steel, you know,
aluminium.
But this time, many of the new economy
sector, advanced manufacturing,
strategic new sector, green energy,
renewable energy sector also have this
overcapacity issue and many of the
capacity were actually newly built up
and some of the technologies are
commodities.
So it's very hard to say, oh, the
technology of high energy, high energy
consumption, high, high, high, high
pollution using those oh, the standard
to draw the line to say what a winner
and losers.
Also, many of these new capacity were
subsidized by local government, were
supported by your Chinese bank sectors.
So the push back will be much higher and
many of them are actually now in
downstream with more private sector
company.
Many also are it were able to export.
So as long as Chinese export were okay
it could be a pushback from the industry
will be strong.
We are still bringing in reserves.
We can still sell to the rest of the
world.
Why you want to shut that stuff?
So that's the first.
The difference in terms of execution
wise, there will probably be much more
pushback because it's more peo private
sector company is more new economy and
the capacity are fairly new.
The second difference was 2015 16 supply
side reform happen, but there were also
key Monga site recoveries.
Right you know China long that does
shantytown project property market had a
big rebound in 2016 2017 was global
synchronized recovery so export had a
very nice rebound.
So you know this time the macro cycle
might be quite different.
Can we still Hong Kong export and
property or will there be new
infrastructure that's driving the
demand?
It's the steel and no.
And the final late this time in
anti-evolution we feel like it's much
broader focus.
So supply reduction is only one piece of
the story but there is also more focus
is in terms of protecting us is on the
supply chain.
So like whether it's the auto companies,
they shouldn't be squeezing the dealers
for, you know, putting that very high
inventory burden on them or they need to
accelerate the payment to the component
suppliers.
And then for e-commerce, Internet
platforms is about you know, you can't
pass on the competition pressure to the
70 merchant on your platform and you
need to step up the support for your
delivery riders.
So these policies are actually negative,
marginally negative for the listed
company, the large cap companies, but
more in supporting the whole ecosystem
and supply chain.
And finally, I think this time there's
also a focus on reducing the government,
local government subsidies and support.
All right.
Which created a lot of positive
competition.
So when presidency emphasize on building
a unified the national market is partly
also that to ring in the local
government behavior and subsidies which
also caused a lot of geopolitical
tensions and criticisms.
So again, bringing in the government
subsidy, it will probably be negative
rather than positive.
So what you're saying, I guess it's
early stages, manage your expectations.
Yes.
In terms of how I can trade on this.
Right.
I mean, markets are kind of going with
it anyways, right?
They have already.
They already are ready already.
If we're going to actually
realistically, then see better pricing,
better margins and better valuations on
the back of this thing.
Our analysts really genuinely have low
expectation, right, Because a few
things.
One is the overcapacity in some sectors
like solar, like cement are substantial,
but the current cut discussed was very
marginal.
And in most the sectors, like for
example, in steel sector, in the solar
glut sector, we talking about production
cut, not capacity reduction and
production cut is only temporary, right?
It's not fundamentally addressing the
supply demand imbalances.
So generally speaking, I would say you
know the as so you related to sectors
like the cement, the steals potentially
will see some more real impact because
it's easier to execute and the sectors
that's already having very low margin,
low utilization again will be easier to
implement where.
As for, like the solar equipment, the
modules, the lithium, some of the EV
sector, it will probably be much harder
to see it coming through in the near
term.
And even now, we don't have a concrete
target for many of the IT sector in
terms of how much to cut or even how
much to suspend production.
So what then is the earnings outlook?
The earnings outlook?
You know, from beginning of year, we saw
in sectors like solar, lithium,
chemicals, market factoring, big
earnings turnaround this year on the
hopes of supply reduction, which hasn't
coming in the first half this year.
So I still worry that in the sectors
that still rely on policy or policy
implementation, there are strong side
the potential downside disappointment.
Whereas when you talk to others, for
example financials like in hernia like
finds insurers, it looks like second
quarter only will be marginally better,
partly because of the equity market
doing well.
Bond yield was going down, so there is
better trading gains and the second
quarter economy was okay.
So, you know, I think different sector
various, but generally the sectors that
were market already pricing, high
expectation for the supply side reform
are likely to be at the for the coming
couple of quarters.
Quick last question for you.
Why has the Asia market been seeing this
revival recently?
I mean, turnovers picked up the Shanghai
Composite 2021.
I just want to for over thinking that is
something else going on there.
Yeah, I think to some extent Asia was a
big laggard this year.
I think even since September last year,
this year was one of the best performing
market globally, Asia lagged.
So I think people are looking at some of
the age spread, right.
And seeing whether there is a reversal
trend to play out.
I think there are some, you know, market
chatters about whether southbound
insurers keep buying a share as healthy.
Should they focus more on the Asia?
But also in May twenties, the major
banks did.
I wrote a round of deposit rate cuts as
a one year rate was cut by 15 basis
points.
Three year time deposit were cut by 25
basis points.
So after the rate cut, I think save the
retail depositors are also looking at
the savings rate.
You're saving you the 1%.
And is it better off to buy the dividend
stocks or buy the equity, which would
give you a 1% in a day?
Right.
So so I think it is a combination of
these factors, mainly more on the floor
as well.
Whitney, it's great to have you were
there in China, equity strategist at B
of A securities coming up here.
Take a closer look at Tesla, which is
warning of a rough few quarters ahead.
Battling slowing sales in the U.S.
and regulatory issues in China.
This is Bloomberg.
Right.
Welcome back for the already.
I think fourth time we're looking at
Tesla suppliers.
Nothing much to see here.
That's just to show and say that Tesla
is a big story today.
Like, I'll be cruel by that end anyway.
Tesla, of course, big mover in the after
hours session, got about four or 5%.
Elon Musk, of course, said this is an
important story, warning of a few rough
quarters ahead as tariff costs increase
and bite into demand.
That's after second quarter sales
plunged, get this, 12%, their worst drop
in at least a decade.
We probably could have a few rough
quarters
out.
I'm not saying the world, but we could.
You know, Q4, Q1.
Maybe Q2.
But once you get to autonomy at scale in
the second half of next year, certainly
by the end of next year, I think the I
was surprised if Tesla's economics are
not very compelling.
Let's bring in our supply chain reporter
daily to break down these earnings for
us.
And you kind of heard in this call,
right, that it's almost like there's
still some heartbreak from this breakup
with President Trump.
When you talk about the impact on
tariffs and the impact from the big
beautiful bill as well on Tesla, you
hear how, you know, Musk is very
downbeat.
He's very kind of flat in his call with
analysts, which ended a couple of hours
ago.
Right.
And, you know, this was the second
quarter pretty this is probably as bad
as it gets, frankly, for now.
Maybe it gets even worse.
We are going to see another difficult
couple of periods ahead, as Elon Musk
warned.
And you know, this is just as Tesla
transitions from just being an EV only
focused company into one.
They want to clearly upsell autonomy,
robo taxis, robots.
And so it's the earnings story around
the EVs, which continues to drag down
the company.
What's all this future looking stuff
which gives Tesla even more value, which
has yet to be fleshed out in detail.
Still hasn't really shown up in any kind
of earnings or any kind of detail which
analysts really want to hear about more.
Yeah, the market can tend to get
impatient, really, when it comes to
these things.
Anything on the Asia Pacific?
Well, there's only one thing on the Asia
Pacific that Elon Musk raised, and that
was this roadblock to getting more
autonomous testing done in China.
So that's going to be a key thing as
they separate out what they're doing in
the rest of the world and in China.
And and so therefore, they're still
facing some roadblocks to getting that
testing launched and to try and catch up
to some of its peers.
And, you know, even it's a bit surprise
more of Asia wasn't mentioned because of
what they've just launched in India
recently.
They've expanded in this India.
A new market for them could help them
drive more sales where they have been
flagging in other parts of the world.
So you've expected maybe Musk to talk
more about some of these new and
emerging markets, more in the Middle
East, more in India, but we haven't
quite heard that as he tries to focus on
a lot of things to try and get Tesla
back on a better footing.
All right.
Jenny, thank you.
There are 80 supply chain reporter and
of course, we to get beth kendig from io
fund joining us to break down those
earnings further in the next hour,
another earnings news alphabet shares
gained in late trade after second
quarter sales beat wall street
estimates.
It's also raising capital spending this
year by 0 billion, with CEO Sundar
Pichai citing rising demand for cloud
and air services.
Google is weaving its flagship AI model
Gemini, into its product portfolio as it
confronts competition from Mehta and
Microsoft.
IBM shares slipped, though, as it
reported a weaker than expected sales in
its closely watched software segment.
Sales for the unit grew 10% on year to
about $7.4 billion, which fell short of
the average analyst estimate.
Evercore ISI says investors are likely
to question how durable IBM's software
growth will be in the second half.
Okay, let's stay on tech.
AMD says chips the chips it buys from
Tsmc's Arizona plant actually cost up to
20% more than those actually made in
Taiwan.
The CEO, Lisa Su, actually spoke to us
exclusively at an event where President
Trump promised the US would win the
global race in tech.
She told us that a White House plan is
crucial to ensuring access to resources.
I think the AI action plan absolutely
helps this notion of bringing up the
resources that are necessary, whether
it's regulatory or power or, you know,
just ensuring that there is a view that
this is a priority.
And if it's a priority for the
administration, it'll be a priority for
the industry.
And, you know, it kind of coalesces all
of the aspects that are necessary.
So it's still hard work.
I don't want to say that, you know, we
can do this, you know, quickly.
It's still multi years, but you will
move some chips from Arizona this year,
I think you said absolutely.
We're going to start manufacturing this
year and we're going to add to it as we
go forward.
One of the things you addressed on stage
was the idea of the relative price
comparison for a semiconductor made here
in the United States versus abroad.
There is a marginal degree of greater
expense.
I think you said it was less than 20%,
more than 5%, somewhere high double
digits.
But if you are building the broader high
performance compute system in the United
States, does it matter?
I mean, how do you approach the sort of
economics of it?
I think the economics of it are we have
to consider the, you know, just
resiliency in the supply chain.
I think we learned that, frankly, from
the pandemic.
You know, the idea that you think about
your supply chains, not just buy the
lowest cost, but also about reliability,
about resiliency and all those things.
I think that's how we're thinking about
U.S.
manufacturing.
And yes, it will be a little bit more
expensive.
You know, frankly, some of the the work
that has been done to
encourage semiconductor investment has
been helpful.
But when you really average it across
everything else that you need to build
this computing infrastructure, I think
it's a very good investment for us to
make to assure that we have, you know,
American men.
Factoring and resiliency.
The action plan will be followed by
action.
One imagines executive orders from the
president and other pieces of specific
policy.
What is left to do to your mind?
What is it actually that needs to be
enacted, either from a supply chain
point of view or your ability to sell
your technologies around the world?
Well, what I really like about the
action plan is I actually believe it's
quite actionable.
So there are lots of things in there
where when we look at it, it's a perfect
blueprint for public private
partnership.
And, you know, we're going to be active
with the administration to try to help
shape some of those conversations about,
you know, what should be exported, what
an open ecosystem looks like.
How do we ensure that AI for science is
front of mind?
You know, we're very active with the
Department of Energy on, you know, the
entire national lab infrastructure,
which can really help accelerate air in
the country.
So, yeah, we're ready to go.
That was A.C.
or Lisa Sue there.
Of course, there's much more ahead on
the big tech results as well.
We talked about bad conduct from IO.
Find the lead analyst there to join us
about 20 minutes with her views on Tesla
and what to watch out for this earnings
season.
Beyond the hype, plenty more ahead.
This is Bloomberg.
Right.
Welcome back.
So this rally that's still taking place,
as you can see, six day look, I'm still
sick.
My heart rate.
Every time I get stressed here at work,
which is probably what you're going to
see anyway if we do an EKG at the
moment.
But yes, anyway, 4% to the upside.
The big the big driver today is really
when you look at tech, for example, SGI
in its reported blowout earnings, great
guidance excuse me, when you look at
what's happening in South Korea and of
course, that's lifting that tide as
well.
You have, of course, this renewed vigor
in the Japanese market.
All things equal, this is what you're
getting six days, the longest win streak
going back to the start of the year.
In fact, so much so and so quickly
enough that when you look at the longer
term chart and price, we're going to put
this at a very top of the next graphic
coming up on your screens and the
bottoms after actually going to show you
a gauge of momentum.
The 14 day artist's eye, it's actually
now at 80, the highest level.
Going back you could make the argument
high is going back to the pandemic.
So, question mark,
are we actually due for a consolidation
across this equity market, which is
then, as you can see, exceptionally
well, and I think within about two or 3%
of that high, even though we hit back in
2020, but yet pay attention to this,
that's not a move you normally see.
That's not a level you normally see us
stay out of for quite and especially
when we get when we see an eight handle
as far as that's concerned.
Yeah, certainly that's one thing to
watch.
Here are signs of maybe overheating
across the Asia Pacific.
One thing, though, what's really driving
this equity rally, of course, still
remains the tech space growth stocks and
the like.
Right.
And we had another sort of catalyst here
today with SK Hynix coming out with
their earnings.
So this is after we saw record earnings.
They planned a quick quick in the
spending on advanced memory chip
capacity and just really reflecting the
surging demand out there and a drive to
stay ahead of its rivals.
So SK Hynix is up as well of 1% that's
kind of lifting the likes of Taiwan semi
semis is up some 2%.
Even Samsung was catching a bit here
this morning, but Tokyo Electron heading
the opposite direction.
We have a lot more on the way in the
next hour of the China show.
This is Bloomberg.
It's almost like a picture.
Welcome back to They're trying to show a
look into the Hong Kong harbor this
morning.
And it's sunny skies.
It's cleared up after this typhoon.
And it looks like things are pretty
still sunny when it comes to Hong Kong.
After we did see those eight shares
reached the highest level since October
2021, Hong Kong has already been hitting
those milestones already.
But certainly we talk about the onshore
market.
That's where you're seeing a lot of that
catch up.
Right.
And when you will just told us, yeah,
there's a lot of going on there too,
that we shouldn't overlook too.
Yeah, people might be trading pairs
there as the you know, the, the gap
between the valuations reached some
extreme recently and maybe there's a bit
of catch up on closing up there of that
valuation gap on shore.
And let's see what turnover looks like
today.
Speculation also on you know what
southbound connect and what other things
investors can do onshore taking their
money here in Hong Kong.
But yeah, the turnover has averaged 1.8
trillion over two days, which is quite
something.
You don't normally see that on this
market.
Nikkei 2 to 5 is now up 2%.
So that now puts us really within
striking distance of a fresh record
there.
The topics, I believe, is already there.
Taiwan is, I guess, indicative of the
tech rally that's been going on.
Nasdaq futures shrugging off the
weakness we're seeing across other after
hours constituents.
We'll talk about Tesla in a moment.
Just a a alluding to that as well going
into today.
Other things taking place.
You have an ECB decision taking place at
a today.
Most economists, if not all, virtually
all with the exception I think of one or
two, do expect
things to largely remain unchanged.
Here's a stock futures one and a half
percent.
Wow, what a move there.
So it is a risk on rally here.
And there's also a SGB sale today.
We should get more details on that this
or next hour, one, five and 30 year
bonds.
And of course, we're also looking at the
tide board here, too, as well.
Yeah, it's interesting that you're
seeing this continue strength into the
currency after what we've been seeing a
lot of inflows certainly into Thailand
as well.
A lot of optimism around trade to the
buy.
It did rise where it is rising the
highest since 2022.
We just got this line also from the
Thailand army are reporting about how
Thai and Cambodian troops clash near a
disputed site there.
This on the back.
What we've been hearing, there's some
some border disputes that have been
flaring up where it's led to both sides
to recall their ambassadors as well.
So we'll continue to watch that one in
Thailand at the border here today.
But in terms of top themes, it's still
about trade, right?
You know, the fact that we heard from
the Philippines ambassador to the US
say, look, 50% and 19%, I should say, is
not the final say right now.
There's an interesting to negotiate in
that deadline.
And he said, look, the president said
15% is probably the floor they're going
to aim to hit there.
And I'm sure many nations are going to
do that with just, what, six, seven days
to go before the deadline.
Yeah, well, Japan got it right.
Yeah.
But Japan does, of course, wield a sort
of bigger euro.
Might try.
We'll see.
Europe might try.
And speaking of Europe right this hour
as well.
Well, today, of course, it's Europe and
China that that's also going to be very
much in focus.
You have President Xi Jinping, of
course, set to meet officials and that
that specific economic relationship
looks kind of tricky.
They could see each seen better days and
see what kind of progress we see there
today.
I mean, Europe has sanctioned some of
the banks over what, you know, China's
role in facilitating trade with Russia.
You have everything that goes on with EV
tariffs as well, rare earths.
So it's really tough to see what could
be tangible and what can be deliverables
in this summit, especially at a time
when you have China and the and you
discussing trade deals with the U.S..
Right.
They don't want to rock the boat just
yet until maybe they get some sort of
framework with Washington so far.
Yeah.
We'll get to the latest on that in a
moment.
In fact, later on in the show, in about
40 minutes, the EU Chamber of Commerce
in China will be joining us to talk us
through that.
While we wait for that later on,
President Trump on our top story there
we go has suggested that he will not go
below, as we were just pointing out
there, 15% as he set so-called
reciprocal tariff rates, indicating that
the floor for levies is actually rising.
You have major economies, including
India and the EU still scrambling to
secure a trade deal that's ahead of this
August one deadline, just about a week
away.
We're going to have a very, very simple
tariff for some of the countries.
Have so many countries you can't
negotiate deals with everyone.
So have a straight, simple tariff of
anywhere between 15 and 50%.
A couple of we have 15 because we
haven't been getting along with those
countries too well.
So we just say let's be 50 and that's
the way it is.
Let's bring in more creative fielder
Emily Strategies, joining us out from
Singapore.
So it seems like we're seeing animal
spirits come back on the back of some of
these trade deals, Mark.
But as Dave has mentioned, you take a
lot of these equity markets and we're
seeing signs of maybe overbought
territory now.
How should we be looking at, you know,
the next few days and weeks when it
comes to risk assets now?
Is it time for a breather?
There's at least some risks around any
trade deal with the European Union,
because there's seems to be an
assumption being priced into the market
that Europe will get a similar kind of
deal to Japan.
So something around the 15% range on the
tariffs.
Now, if they don't, if it fails or if
it's delayed much longer and it looks as
though that tariff level could go
higher, that would certainly be an issue
for markets to deal with because they're
not really expecting that.
So they'll be watching very closely how
that European deal plays out.
They'll also be watching what happens
between Europe and China as well.
But more much more importantly is
whether Europe can secure such a
favourable or what is seen as such a
favorable deal as Japan, because that
would really disrupt markets, especially
European equities, if they can't achieve
that.
So you would see some pretty high
volatility around there for the euro was
real.
The euro is performing very well in the
last few days, again, on the assumption
that Europe is going to get a good deal
here.
So there's a lot resting on that
European decision.
As you say, the ECB, nobody expects them
to actually change rates today, but
their outlook could certainly be
affected by what they see coming in
terms of the trade deal.
So you may see them sounding a little
bit more hawkish if they think that deal
is coming through.
ECB could sound a bit more hawkish than
expected tonight when they start
speaking after the minutes are out.
They've also got the Fed meeting next
week.
And we've already heard the commerce
secretary, Nick, weigh in today.
Another person saying that the Federal
Reserve's would lower interest rates
more quickly, putting more pressure on
Jerome Powell.
So certainly next week you've got not
only these old deadlines of August the
first.
Coming up, you've got a Fed meeting as
well, and the Bank of Japan decision as
well.
There's plenty up in the air, but
certainly in the very near term, the EU
trade deal is probably the most
significant thing on the table for
traders.
Mark, maybe just to also ask you about
within within this equity market rally
in the region.
Japan obviously has seen a revival from
yesterday going into today.
The topics index, I'm looking at volumes
33% heavier again than usual for this
time of the day.
What's going on in Japan?
Is there still some momentum we can
chase there?
If you're looking at catch up plays,
rotation.
I mean, Japan just stands out by miles
across the European markets even after
yesterday's huge rally.
The topics, Nikkei index, they're way
behind the kind of gains we've seen this
year for cost B Hang Seng index, heat
shares.
It's so far behind.
People obviously were sitting on the
sidelines waiting to see what would
happen for Japan.
Money starting to pour in now.
Those trading volumes that we saw
yesterday were the biggest since April.
That's very encouraging for new money,
which is coming into the market.
You want to see that kind of momentum
continuing and the fact that the market
still in the green today is another very
good sign.
But if you're if you're a big portfolio
manager and you've had a very good first
half of the year based on Hong Kong and
Korean equities, why wouldn't you be
switching some of that money into Japan,
which is a clear laggard?
Now he's got the trade deal behind it.
The yen, although it's slightly stronger
today, it's still relatively weak in the
big picture scheme.
So the yen favors the Japanese market as
well.
The high yields in Japan is pretty much
priced in anyway.
Bank of Japan is clearly behind the
curve.
They probably won't raise interest rates
again this year, but at such a slow
pace, it's hardly going to make any
difference to the equity market at all.
So all the things are going into place,
even the political situation is getting
a bit clearer in Japan as well.
So from an external point of view, Japan
suddenly looks a lot more interesting.
It's a global portfolio managers and
there's plenty of catch up room with the
rest of the markets.
Mark, you mentioned that Pacific today.
You called it spicy.
Tell us why.
Well, if you again, they've pushed the
fixing below 714 for the first time
since early November, which if you look
at the steps they've taken over the past
few days, these are pretty large moves
in the context of the people see who
normally only change the fixing by just
a few pips a day.
And you can you can see some of this is
probably an olive branch to the European
discussions that are going on with the
trade here, because in the background
the driver of the PBOC fixing is the
euro.
The Euro Yuan Cross is near multi-year
highs.
Euro is super strong against the yuan
and by lowering the dollar yuan fixing,
they're helping to moderate some of
those moves.
If the PBOC did nothing.
Euro yuan will be at all time highs and
that wouldn't be a good signal to the
trade negotiations between China and
Europe.
So really what what the BBC is doing
here, they're giving a signal to Asian
currencies.
Yes, we we're in line with you.
We see further strength across the board
there.
But they're also reaching out to Europe
as well, saying, look, we're not trying
to make things too difficult for you.
We're going to keep the fixing going in
a direction, which means that the Euro
yuan won't get too much stronger for the
time being.
That may help the negotiations go a
little bit more smoothly.
Mark, Thank you.
Mark Cranfield there out of our team
over in Singapore for us as we head into
this break.
MSCI Asia Pacific now highest level here
in about four years or so.
Longest win streak in since the start of
the year.
We're talking our counting now six
straight days because of that, because
of other things taking place.
Japan, as you can see, is now up 2%
going into the last 20 minutes of the
morning session.
Plenty more ahead.
This is the China show.
Well, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has told
investors to prepare for what could be a
rough few quarters ahead after sales in
the prior period fell 12%, the company's
worst result in more than a decade.
He also spoke on the earnings call about
regulatory challenges in China.
And then we also have some very good
regulatory regulatory challenges in
China, which were helping to unblock
shortly where we got because we also
cannot wait
to visit Russia and China currently
blocked that suit.
And that's also that's another major.
It's really is the single biggest the
main driver.
Let's bring in Beth Kendig, lead analyst
at IO Fund, of course, which runs the
tech focused stock portfolios.
Beth.
Good morning from the Asia Pacific.
Thank you for joining us.
Lots to get into.
I was hoping to start with Tesla and
it's it's I think one thing that did
stand out just as we were hearing that
soundbite, it's just the tone coming
through out of the part of Elon Musk,
who normally doesn't exude that exude
that sort of low level of confidence.
And I wonder how you're looking at the
company itself currently, given where
the stock price is as well to consider
that, too.
Sure.
Good to see you both again.
You know, there are puts and takes
tonight with Tesla's report.
On one hand, there was a quarter over
quarter improvement in the margins.
There was actually a 4% rebound in the
average sales price.
So that was a positive.
But the uncertainty of what lies ahead
is really weighing on the stock after
hours.
Not only did we hear some that
regulatory issues in China, but
inventory was up 21%.
Deliveries were down 13%.
That would point to demand issues and an
oversupply.
And all of that is ahead of that if you
credit expiring at the end of September.
So, again, the stock is down after hours
and deservedly so, considering the
uncertainty of what is coming next
quarter.
And I mean how you look at the stock is
is really kind of
determine of what how you think it's
going to perform or is it actually, you
know, a core business is still an
automaker or do you look at this company
and the innovation that you're seeing?
Is it an AI?
Is it a robotics juggernaut?
Right.
I mean, how should we actually look at
this this company out there?
Yeah, right here, right now.
This is a car company.
I don't think that can be.
There's nothing that proves that R&D
around AI is monetizing.
And that is really what is important for
tech investors is broadly, even
speaking, who is monetizing AI right
now.
And that's really important considering
the tens of billions being poured in to,
you know, whether it's data centers,
whether it's training models, there's
tens of billions being poured into that.
And until a company can put out material
evidence of the rely on that CapEx or
that R&D spend, for me, when we're
talking about Tesla, it remains a car
company.
For example, they were expected to
deliver 2 million vehicles this year.
They've delivered about 700,000 750,000.
They're about a million short, 1.1
million short.
And until that's all cleared up, I think
the AI story, again, that we haven't
seen monetized yet is in the back seat.
Yeah.
I guess to the point you just made
there, there are other options.
You know, if you if you like A.I., there
are other options beyond, beyond, beyond
Tesla.
And, you know, this earnings season, I'm
looking at Alphabet, for example, and
the what looks to be a good problem to
have.
They're running into some issues,
scaling up CapEx and getting products to
the market.
How how are you looking at Alphabet up
these days?
Both
Yeah, Alphabet.
I mean, this is this was a hotly debated
stock going into the earnings because
the question was how is search
monetizing given the time being spent in
apps like GPT?
They did clear that hurdle tonight.
They accelerated search.
So not only is actually helping
internally there with their own you
know, with their own apps, their own
leading segment.
And when you look at Google Cloud,
that's also accelerating.
But again, we're seeing some weak price
action because it goes back to the fact
that there are tens of billions being
spent.
Alphabet Alphabet raised their CapEx to
about 85 billion compared to about 12
billion that they're seeing in revenue
on Google Cloud.
So there's definitely a gap there
between what's being spent and what
these companies can report.
My favorite actually would be Microsoft.
I think Microsoft is in a very material
way saying we have our ROI on that
CapEx.
Yeah, it's interesting, Beth.
You look at the after hours trade and
alphabet, as soon as I mentioned that
CapEx figure.
It basically killed that after hours
rally and the stock.
So how are investors basically still
running out of patience about big
spending when it comes to.
I know.
Yes.
And now I got my start in Silicon
Valley.
I was there for over a decade.
And the way Silicon Valley does it is
very different than Wall Street.
Wall Street wants to see those profits
immediately.
And really, this is going to take some
time.
I don't doubt that these companies in
the long run will be winners.
It's going to take some time.
And I think there's better ways to play
it right.
We look at the 85 billion that Google is
spending.
Well, who is that going to?
It's going to be hardware.
And I think, again, right here, right
now, that's a much better way to
position
Beth.
And, you know, to the point that you
just made, too, like recently when I say
recently, the last let's call it last
five or six weeks.
AI has again become not just, you know,
you know, the biggest part of investors
mindset, also the biggest driver of
returns overall.
You look at the back seven, how are you
viewing valuations at the point at the
moment?
Many are stretched.
I think you can see them lower.
In fact, my firm is rotating away from
those stretched valuations and favoring
some of these hardware plays or because
they're growing so rapidly.
There are a couple of hardware companies
growing 300%.
Again, because this CapEx just flows
straight down the line.
And so to me, it's rotate more to those
hypergrowth hardware stocks for now.
Can you tell us what what you won't
touch and what maybe you think you could
rotate to now within that sort of
universe?
When I look at something like meta metal
historically has not traded this high
and meta is participated in massive
trends such as mobile when it became a
native app and and social media and ads
and it's never traded this high.
So we are personally rotating out of
that and we really favor things like
Esoteric Labs and Credo, which are both
our hardware stocks that in the
networking layer that serve
the supply in NVIDIA and they also
supply custom silicon and all those tens
of billions.
Doesn't matter if it's coming from
Google Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, they
filter down into that supply chain.
It's just a much safer bet in my opinion
right now.
Beth, it's great to have you didn't even
talk about a video today, but
continually tech analyst at AOL, if I'm
going to get you back, the company,
Moorhead, this is Bloomberg.
The US Commerce Secretary has described
China's export ban on a U.S.
government employee as outrageous
behavior.
Howard Lutnick also spoke to us about
the decision to ease restrictions on age
28 chip sales.
If China delivers more magnets, the H.
20 was the third best chip in the world,
and now it's the fourth best because the
Blackwell is the best.
There's an H 200, H 100.
So an H 20 is the fourth best chip.
And I think the president has decided
that if things are going well with
China, that they can buy them.
So I think that decision has been made.
We are putting on the licensing
mechanism and we are getting that going.
But the President has decided that the
Chinese can buy them, but that's in a
balanced way with the Chinese delivering
on the deal that we made with them.
And they're delivering rare earths to
American manufacturers.
So when you sit across from Chinese
counterparts next week, what do you plan
to discuss with them?
Is loosening export controls more more
export controls on the table?
I think what we talk about is there's a
line right below the line.
We are giant economies.
We should trade with each other, right?
They want to buy our produce.
They want to buy our vegetables.
Right.
They need they don't grow everything.
They don't have the breadbasket of
America that we have.
So they want to buy those products.
And you know what?
There's lots of things that they make
that we want to buy, that we want
inexpensive things on our shelves.
So let's talk below the line.
Let's open the market better in China
and let us sell more things in China.
And then at the line where we're
competitive, you know, where is that
line?
Where above that line where they're not
going to sell us their hypersonic
missiles and we're not selling them our
best chips?
Those two things are not happening
because they're a competitor.
They are a competitor.
And what we're really going to discuss
is where's that line?
Are the age twenties above the line or
below the line?
That's really nuance and that's
discussion.
But of course, would we like to buy baby
clothes that are inexpensive?
Of course we would.
So that makes perfect sense.
So let's open the market down here.
Right.
We're never opening the market up here.
And what do we discuss?
We discuss that line of what's over it
and what's under it.
But do we want more of this, them
selling it to us and not selling it to
them?
The president and President Xi from
China agreed that they would like to do
more business there.
So we're going to talk about opening the
market more so things that make sense to
open it.
And we're really going to discuss the
areas that maybe we should really be
addressing.
Is that yes, or is that No.
One area?
I just want to finish on this.
I'm curious if you're going to address
directly, because it's the Commerce
Department, an employee of yours is
facing an exit ban right now from China.
Do you have any update on this?
It's unbelievable.
Right?
So he has there was an employee because
he's a Chinese national who was working
in the patent office and he went home
and he was arrested and they're holding
his passport.
I mean, it's so I give that to the State
Department and the State Department
deals with that.
But it is it is outrageous behavior.
There you go.
There was the US Commerce Secretary,
Howard Lutnick, with Anna maria, of
course, Annmarie Horden in the US.
A quick glance at markets of two things
to tell you about right now.
Job market yields are on the way up a
steeper curve.
As you can see the 30 year yield.
And we'll get the bond auction in a
moment.
Of course, a couple of more details
there.
Also worth pointing out, though, is the
economic survey out for July.
This is a survey we do on a monthly
basis, and it does show a slight uptick
as far as the growth expectations are
concerned, consistent really with the
data that's come through recently.
Yeah, I was just looking at my inbox, I
believe it was ANZ that talked about
this whole China reflation strategy,
actually talking about reflation.
All right.
Given what we've been seeing with
anti-evolution this this dam project, so
that certainly is lifting the likes of
some of these commodities and maybe can
lift China out of deflation.
Right.
That's the goal.
That's the dream.
Certainly how it happens there.
You know, when even berated mentioned,
you know, it is a 3 to 5 year sort of
rising to think about when it comes to
that.
That's why we're checking out those
miners there today as well.
But in head, this is Bloomberg.
I think it's very important to know
that, you know, 15% for Japan, for
reciprocal tariffs, for all those.
That is a different kind of deal.
But because the Japanese proposed a very
innovative solution.
U.S.
Treasury Secretary Scott Benson there
speaking about that trade deal with
Tokyo.
And it's almost 11:30 a.m.
there.
Markets saying that lunch break and we
continue to see this rally getting fired
up.
Intel getting lower.
Volumes are concerned.
They're surging once again here.
And it's interesting, right?
I think it was late afternoon, Dave,
what we heard from the prime minister,
Ishiba
one very interesting calls.
He says he's vowing to remain in as as
the leader despite all the speculation,
as local media reports of him maybe
possibly resigning in a few weeks.
Yeah, it's interesting how that the news
lines evolve this time yesterday, right.
It started with him not commenting on
his future when they were talking about
the trade deal.
Then you had one or two local reports
coming out, one giving a timeline and
August another one coming in and say it
was going to happen soon.
And then and then it's about face as far
as that's concerned.
But I guess suffice to say,
there tends to be fire when there is
smoke.
I think it was something I would say,
but certainly it is something to to
watch going forward.
And really what that means for not the
trade deal, but domestic politics.
Right.
It just underscores this reflation
story, which is a good thing for
markets.
But domestically, of course, there needs
to be some some way to address that,
too.
We're looking at markets there.
I think we just showed you that.
Can we show that again, please, if we
can do so.
The Nikkei is actually very near a new
record now following the topics index,
which I think hit that milestone.
And basically what's happened is right,
like if you sort out the winners and
losers is a great piece out from our
team in Tokyo about how this Japan trade
deal is basically move some of the
losers back to be winners and vice
versa.
So you look at car makers, for example,
machinery makers and banks are now seen
as winners of this deal.
And we obviously saw that relief rally
in the autos yesterday after we heard
that those upstairs have been lowered.
And the flip side, you're starting to
see defense related stocks, domestic
demand linked shares of real estate
firms, for example, are now headed the
opposite direction.
Yeah, I mean, higher rates, what's that
going to do as far as that's concerned?
And I think the one big loser, a quote
unquote, reasonably is our colleague
Cheri, who's been exhausted covering all
of these things for us because we've
we've had to drag her into the studio
last minute several times yesterday.
Yeah, well deserved.
At least not for now, Sherry.
But if you're listening, stay tuned if
you might need you at some point soon,
particularly when the Nikkei actually
hits that new record here of 42,000.
I'm sounding out already.
Start to make up.
Okay.
Well, the Japan rally has been taking
place.
China's also been doing very well.
The market's been rallying there.
You know, there's a lot of conversations
around how do I gain exposure to China?
Is it the ETF space in Hong Kong?
When you look at onshore markets,
certainly Hong Kong has been the primary
destination.
ETF connectivity has really been a big
topic of late, especially here in the
region.
Yeah, and Evan just introduced his
latest ETF on the Singapore exchange.
Now joining us now is fun being deputy
CEO and CIO of IFA management Singapore.
If I'm back it's great to have you.
Can you tell us a bit more about behind
this ETF, the timing of it and why
Singapore in particular?
Hi.
It's a good pleasure to be here.
Thank you for having me here.
My name is being fun.
I'm from Earphone Management Singapore.
Regarding the timing of a Chinext ETF.
So we do believe CHINEXT index maximum
value has been recognized by many
investors today, given the year to date
performance.
And going forward, we do see the great
potential for
further, further investment cases to be
reviewed by institutional and retail
investors.
Thank you.
Okay, fine.
This is this is David.
The other question I have is why?
Why the China X Index specifically?
Sure.
The Chinext index has been a large
boost.
15 years of history.
Chinext has a focus on innovation and a
girl was driven companies and flipped
chinext itself.
It has some a special listing rules.
So first one, It's a first board adopted
of the IBEX, the registration based IPO
system back in 2020.
Eight also allow have several features
like they allow the
profit of companies to be listed.
They also allow the dual share classes
and they also have a negative screening
list too, making sure the indexes are
really fostering the innovation and the
technology driven industries as well as
the traditional industries integrating
where's the generation elements?
And so for Chinext itself, it has more
than 70% of the index value coming from
the new economy sectors, but within the
70% itself, it also have a rather
diversified focus, not only just the
technologies but also the digital
economy, a portion of that.
So meaning chinext is growth and
innovation focused.
But in the meantime, it's also
diversified within the new economy
sectors.
Yeah, you know, it's interesting, right?
Because certainly that's where most of
those these companies list.
But I have to say they're not really big
household names, which overseas
investors might not really be attuned
to.
Right.
Maybe they'd rather look at something
like the HS tech, for example.
I'm just wondering what sort of overseas
appetite do you actually see for some of
these companies now that big?
I don't know by your sound, the
conversation we had in recent months, we
do see a mismatch between the presence
of China in terms of the global
industrial chain and of the allocation
of the global asset allocations portion
of China.
And I believe the mismatch between those
two reflects some of the concern of our
China economy.
Looking forward, we do see this gap will
have a great potential to be narrowing
down and finally coming down to the
allocation to China technology portion.
The CHINEXT itself does provide a better
opportunities for access to accessing
the high growing and growth industries
from the world's second largest economy
focus on artificial intelligence,
biotech,
and also the technology driven
industries.
For those, I think Chinext itself and
also the Baidu Solution products are run
chinext providing investors globally and
domestically a chance to enjoy the
dividend from China's economy and
technology growth stories.
Yeah, and in this case via via Singapore
of course where where you are.
And I wonder, do you have any
projections or estimates how much flow
in a home you expect to see here?
We do tracking the monthly flow file for
global asset allocation to China
closely.
And Singapore is one of the most
important global asset allocation hub.
So far, I mean, in the past couple of
weeks China markets was doing quite
strong and we do see the interest from
both state institutions and retail
investors coming into the the China
story investment stories for the for the
in the mid-term or long term for that
for that for the inflow.
Currently
the the asset allocation flow for China
is relatively is still underweight.
But ever since first quarter of this
year we do see that and the rating has
been narrowed down and this narrowed
down the money flow.
They quite a few of them is using the
ETF as the exciting to has.
We do see strong interest for China
themed and focused ETF both locally and
globally around the globe.
Yeah thank you so much fun being if ever
you're in Hong Kong next to let us know
of course let's let's let's bring you
here into our studios here Hi to the
team at E funds they're funding deputy
CEO and CIO event management Singapore
on the latest product.
And of course what's going on there with
the cross-border ETF connectivity
between between China and Singapore.
Right.
Coming up here, more on today's meeting
with EU and Chinese leaders in Beijing.
The EU Chamber of Commerce president
will be joining us to discuss the
challenges facing relations and maybe
greater and more important context on
these meetings taking place, in fact,
maybe even right now.
That's coming up soon.
And as we go into the break and take a
short break, we're looking at
benchmarks.
And you know what?
We reverse the early weakness.
We're now higher again on the Hang Seng
index.
More on these lines coming through here
out of CCTV.
And it seems to be they're looking to
address the
excessive content.
Here it is again, excessive competition.
China's market regulator is looking to
rectify excessive competition.
That's according to CCTV.
Also in my inbox, just dropping right
now.
So we had a conversation with B of A
morgan Stanley is out with its own note.
And yes, go ahead, Yvonne.
Yeah, we just got some lines from CCTV
as well that now President Xi is going
to be meeting.
The EU is voluntarily.
And Costa, of course, as we see this
summit kick off as well between the EU
and China.
So lots going on.
We'll get you more coming up.
This is Bloomberg.
All right.
We are just getting those lines from
KTTV.
And it has been confirmed that, you
know, now we are likely to see President
Xi and U.S.
Ursula von der Leyen to be speaking
later on today in the summit, along with
the European Council President Costa as
well.
So we're talking about high level talks
right now from leaders from the E.U.
as well.
Will be meeting with the Chinese
president today in Beijing, the first
in-person summit since 2023.
Joining us now is someone who also be
attending some of these summit meetings.
Jens, as Glenda is president of the E.U.
Chamber of Commerce in China.
He joins us live from Beijing this
morning.
Jennings, it's always great to have you.
What's going be the message to European
and Chinese leaders in your meeting
today?
I think there are several.
From from all part, the main focus will
be on trade and market access.
We are concerned about what we are
seeing in terms of trade imbalances
growing ever wider.
And we continue to see continued
restrictions on market access for
European companies.
And a few months ago we released our
annual business confidence survey and
67% of our members told us that they
have been losing business opportunities
because of market access restriction,
and that number is simply too, too high.
And we need to bring that down somehow.
And then, of course, similar to Chinese
companies, we are struggling with the
evolution with overcapacity, with
persistent deflation.
We have now had a 32 consecutive months
of producer price deflation, and that is
something that is harming us as much as
it's, I mean,
Chinese companies.
And of course, on the positive side, in
particular on the company's
decarbonisation agenda.
There's a lot we can do together, and we
all recognize that China would be a
critically important enabler for Europe
to reach its ambitious climate goals.
On market access.
I'm curious, what would your advice be
to the European leaders who are who will
have an audience, of course, with top
Chinese officials?
And is it realistic to expect progress
on that front at this specific meeting?
Of course.
Yeah.
You know, I don't think that any of us
are too optimistic in terms of any sort
of grand agreement being reached.
And I don't think that this is really
what we should aspire to.
I think the backdrop of this meeting
here is that we have the 50th
anniversary of bilateral diplomatic
relations between the European Union and
China.
This is a relationship that has created
immense value for both China and for
Europe.
But maybe now when we have the invasion
anniversary, there is an opportunity at
time for us to reflect on how do we
ensure that we have a relationship going
forward that continue to deliver
benefits from both sides.
And what we're seeing right now is this
increase in trade tension and this
perception in particular in Europe, that
the benefits of the relationship is no
longer being distributed in an equitable
manner.
And for us, the important thing is that
both sides realize that we are a little
bit on a burning platform and that we
need to have these serious conversations
about how sort of to recalibrate so that
Europe can also see that it makes sense
that we continue to engage at the very
high and very deep level that we are
doing today, specifically when it comes
to market access.
We have seen on the one hand that as the
Chinese government has mentioned in
several statement, that there is a
movement in some industries towards
wider opening towards reform.
But we also see that there is an
increased focus on security, on
localization, on import substitution and
self-sufficiency, on self-reliance.
And these are some of the things that
that that worry European companies and
where we see restrictions are popping up
and related specifically to some of
those localization requirements.
And then this is coming at a time in
which the backdrop where the EU and
China are both trying to at least
confirm some sort of trade deal with the
U.S.
how do you see those negotiations
impacting what happens between the EU
and China today?
Because
some would say maybe they're unlikely to
rock the boat because they're waiting to
see what D.C.
says or does it give more of a reason
for the EU to be more emboldened to be
firm on China?
Yeah, you know, there's no doubt, of
course, that what's happening outside of
the bilateral EU-China relationship is
impacting the EU-China relationship.
But I think one of the challenges over
time in the relationship has been that
the relationship between Europe and
China has also always been seen through
the lens of the relationship with the
United States.
And I think we need to recognize if we
are to move forward, that there are
issues that are specific to the EU-China
relationship and that we need to have a
sharp focus on these strikes.
In terms of deindustrialization in
Europe and in terms of access for
European companies in China.
So, yes, there will be an impact, but I
think it's very, very important that we
do not lose sight of the fact that there
are issues that are specific to the
EU-China relationship.
And we also stay laser focused on these
issues as we go forward.
Do you see those issues being resolved
over the next year?
Well, I think that's a question that we
all
are waiting to see.
The most urgent issue right now,
obviously, is related to export controls
in China estate and magnets.
And that is something that has delivered
a blow to many European companies and
also has sort of shaken the confidence
in China as a reliable and predictable
supplier.
So one thing that we hope is that this
is being addressed at this particular
summit here.
So we have this certainty that we have
this clear line inside that
manufacturing that European companies
will not incur unnecessary losses
because they don't have this access.
And we think this is one of the things
that can be done to restore confidence.
That is that a model is found where sort
of a more general licensing scheme is
devised that allow business continuity
for European companies.
That is one of the things that would
help to to strengthen confidence going
forward.
Jens, you mentioned about producer
prices and talking about, you know, how
long we've been staying in deflation.
Some of the anti-evolution sort of
efforts is also maybe hurting some of
the companies that are part of your
members as well.
How difficult is business now for
European companies operating in China
and.
How important is China still as a market
for some of these companies?
It's a really, really good question.
And again, in our business confidence
survey that we just published a few
months ago, we saw that 70% of our 7000
members are now telling us that they are
getting similar or higher profit margins
outside China compared to inside China.
So you can say from that perspective,
maybe China's attractiveness is eroding
and a little bit relative to other
countries, but we're actually seeing an
interesting phenomenon.
More than a quarter of our members are
actually increasing their offshoring in
China.
And we think there are several reasons
for that.
One reason is, of course, that
offshoring in China is a way to de-risk
your in China.
For China as supply chain, you minimize
sort of your vulnerability for your
China in China for China supply chain.
If you sort of reduce your dependency on
on, on and on outside supply chains.
But the other factor that I think is
very interesting and I think Europe also
needs to pay attention, is that we see
multinational European companies, they
obviously need to compete against other
companies.
And the way that you win in the market
is to have better products at a lower
price.
Now what we see is in order to have the
best, best product at the most
attractive price, you obviously need to
source the components where you get the
best components at the most attractive
price and in many, many cases that is
here in China.
So we see actually in many ways that
European business is becoming not less
dependent, but perhaps more dependent on
China.
So actually more European companies on
shoring in China.
Yes, that's interesting.
And I want to ask you, among your
members, is it not almost a conscious or
deliberate effort to and is it possible,
in their view, to effectively make their
supply chains in China self-contained
and self-sustainable?
We are beginning to see, in particular
for companies that are in China, for
China to have independent and
self-sustained autonomous supply chains.
And this is, of course, another area
where we see geopolitics playing a role.
There is an emphasis in particular in
the United States, but also increasingly
in China on having entirely managed
supply chains within the borders of of
the country is one of those things that
unfortunately are creating
inefficiencies for our members because
we are creating global supply chains.
And if you need to invest in having
entirely separate
supply chains in China, it sort of
reduces your ability to achieve
economies of scale and to utilize
capacity outside of China.
So it's actually not something we
welcome, but we think many companies,
because of these pressures and are
feeling forced to begin to Sino and some
of their
supply chains.
We see, for example, within automotive.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
We'll let you go.
I know you have a short trip to Trek to
make that to the Great Hall of the
People for some for some meetings we
believe in Eskil and there thank you so
much President at the EU Chamber of
Commerce in China subscribers can watch
us live.
Or if you missed some parts of that
specific interview, you can scroll back
a little bit on the TV function to go
dive into any of the securities or
functions that we talk about here on the
show, become part of the conversation
centered instant messages.
Check it out.
TV go.
This is.
Right.
Welcome back.
You as futures are doing this.
Okay.
So interesting.
We just got some reports, I believe,
that a former property manager under
president is headed to the Fed on
Thursday.
That's President Trump, of course.
Maybe to, um, I don't know, do ocular of
the, um, renovations.
What what's been sort of the crux of
this sort of saga between Trump and
Powell is this whole criticism about the
central bank's renovations.
Right?
So he has been demanding for some sort
of visit to really take a look at this
renovation project himself.
So Thursday's been the confirmed time.
I think they were trying to do Friday,
but then it was rejected because the
Trump has to go eat with some senators
that evening as well.
So we're now confirming that that visit
is happening.
Right.
So whether we see what happens and what
comes out, maybe a little bit more
fireworks there when it comes to this
criticism that the president has with
Jay Powell for not cutting rates,
basically.
Yeah.
Okay.
So also.
Yeah, So on top of that, Rickie, we're
also looking at the ECB decision that is
largely expected to remain uneventful,
but it's really in the guidance and the
change in the outlook, which might
actually give us something to talk about
given everything that's going on or what
hasn't been resolved yet as far as the
trade negotiations are concerned.
That comes up, of course, later today.
We're now six days here in Asia Pacific
on the as you can see, we've shaken off
the early cobwebs here on the Hang Seng
index.
Yeah, four year highs.
We extended that rally once again.
You're seeing four year highs in
Asia-pacific's as well.
So you talk about how the stock is doing
on AP.
Were up session highs of 1% here right
now are we do for a breather we've been
talking about the RSI.
I think you look a little bit overheated
but doesn't seem like that's the case
here today.
This has been worth.
